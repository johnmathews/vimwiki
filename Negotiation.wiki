= Salary negotiation = 

* I'm not really comfortable sharing my current salary
* I would prefer to focus on the value I can add to this company rather than what I'm paid in my current role
* I don't have a specific number in mind, and you know better than me what value my skill set and experience could bring to the company 
* I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation 

Don't say want - because you deserve

Don't say more - be number specific

Don't say yes - wait for them to say yes or for you to run out of requests

Don't apologise

Don't say no - express it positively
