A *remote* is a copy of your local repository which is held somewhere else (on GitHub's servers, in this case). *you are creating a remote called origin*. This is the name that is conventionally given to your main remote. You should push changes up to your origin remote on a regular basis so you have an up-to-date backup of your code and its history.

=== Stop bugging me for the rsa key thing: === 
In terminal: $ eval `ssh-agent -s`
