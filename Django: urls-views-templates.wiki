= Django: Setting up pages =

The routine is:
*URLs* -> *views* -> *templates*

For cookie-cutter, the folder with the project name is not an app it is the base.

*Create an app:* `python manage.py startapp name`

== The routine ==
1. The browser requests a page
2. The server gets the request and django looks in `settings.py` for `ROOT_URL_CONF=x.urls`
3. which points to the root urlpatterns file `x.urls.py`
4. django goes to `x.urls.py` and gets the `<urlpatterns>` list
5. it goes through the list in order and stops at the first entry where the requested url matches the pattern
6. each item in `urlpatterns` is a tuple of `[<pattern>,<view>,<name>]`
7. django gets the view associated with the pattern.
8. it then goes to `views.py` and executes the correct view. 
   
== Models ==
- A model contains column names for each database table and also defines how the columns are related to each other.
- `models.py` contains classes
- A column is the canonical source of truth.
