= How to write a book =

=== Overview: ===
    * The purpose is to share information or to entertain.
    * If it does that then it is a success.
    * Take your ego out of it - it doesn't have to be fancy or perfect.

=== Step 1: === 
    * Write an out of order outline. 
    * Write down everything that you might want to be in the book.
    * This should take about half an hour or an hour.
    * Don't evaluate ideas or negotiate with yourself.
    * If you happen to come up with another idea for another book, just put it in brackets.

=== Step 2: ===
    * Just go through the list and write about each thing you've written down.
    * Don't go through the list in order, start with the topics that are most exciting or interesting to write about.
    * This will allow you to do your best writing and by the time you get to the hardest parts, the book will be almost done and you will have enough momentum to push through.
    * Set a certain amount of time to finish the book (14 days usually) and divide the 30,000 words by that time, rounding up.

=== Step 3: ===
    * As you're writing, don't worry about anything other than getting useful information onto the page. You can edit and clarify later. If you try to do both at the same time you will be very slow.

=== Step 4: ===
    * Once the information is on the page and all the points have been dealt with, do several passes where you re-read, fix typos and improve the writing. You'll probably need to write some chapters or section which serve to transition from one topic to the next.
    * The trick is to realise that once you've got 30-40k words down covering all your points, everything else seems easy and there's just a few steps left to get it published.

=== Step 5: === 
    * Layout: Doing it yourself can be slow. Get someone on fiverr to do it for about $100 for both ebook and paperback.
