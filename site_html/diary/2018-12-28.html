Build a web app that provides analysis of crypto and finance. This will provide an interesting and useful service to people I may want to work with and allow me to learn how to crete and deploy a web app with automated components. I will do this incrementally.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Pipes and Glue:-1. What do I expect to happen?"></span><strong id="1. What do I expect to happen?">1. What do I expect to happen?</strong><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I intend to build a data pipline and web application that sources and serves interesting metrics on cryptocurrency networks and finance. 

<li>
I will do this in small phases where each phase is a stand alone achievement. If I do not complete a phase I will still be able to leverage the previous phases fully. This will create a minimum amount of 'wasted time' if something doesn't work out.

<li>
Each phase will compound into a large and valuable project. 

</ul>
 
<ul>
<li>
I expect that I will use my time and energies more efficiently if I have a structured plan about what I want to build. 

<li>
The project needs to meet several goals at the same time, so that time and effort is spent as efficiently as possible. 

<li>
There are several goals to achieve at once, ranging from pragmatic and risk averse (short term) to moon shot dreams with catapult/unlocking potential (long term).

</ul>

<p>
<em>Pragmatic goals:</em><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Demonstrate my skills to potential employers if I'm forced to find another job in 2019.

<li>
Practice specialist skills that I am not using in my current role.

<li>
Enjoy the benefits of creating something and writing. This is inspring and creates a feeling of satisfaction.

</ul>

<p>
<em>Moonshots and catapults:</em><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Become a 'full stack' data scientist with fewer weak points and blind spots

<li>
Create a side project that might become revenue generating

<li>
Make me more desirable to employers and therefore unlock a higher salary or a job with better benefits (flexibility, work from home, autonomy/self*direction, holidays, etc.)

</ul>

Based on previous experience writing blog posts and tackling technical challenges incrementally, I am confident that a large and impenetrable problem can be solved in many small steps. Writing about the steps is a fundamental part of gaining understanding as it allows me to reflect and structure my thoughts, crystalising what I know and providing opportunity to see complimentary or second-order benefits.

Confident that the benefits will be worth the effort

<li>
Confident that the reasoning based on experience is valid.

Apprehensive about finding the neccesary time to focus on a problem.

<p>
I'm hungry and probaly dehydrated. Feeling a bit sick from having eaten too much chocolate.

I need to focus on my long term goals and professional development in the midst of lots of immediate demands on my time and attention, both at work and at home. 
I expect a lot of challenges with time and energy management when my son arrives in January and therefore I need a good plan. 
It's possible that Blockport will not survice through 2019 and I need to ensure a financially smooth transition into what ever happens after.

<ul>
<li>
I need to identify the most efficent path to success, and then find good resources that teach me how to use that path.

<li>
Finding good online resources will be key to progressing fast. 

<li>
Working for small amounts of time in a focussed and energetic way will also be crucial.

<span id="Pipes and Glue:-9. Alternatives that were seriously considered and why they were rejected:"></span><strong id="9. Alternatives that were seriously considered and why they were rejected:">9. Alternatives that were seriously considered and why they were rejected:</strong><br>
Alternatives were rejected because they didnt combine enough different goals, and the compounding benefits werent as great. I need to tie together different existing skills, gain new complimentary skills and create something that looks useful to others.
</p>

<p>
This project isn't mapped out yet. I will map out only 1 phase at a time. This will keep the planning and pressure low, and allow the project to take shape organically, following what is interesting.

Range with 0 being the worst and 10 the best:<br>
<code>0.</code> Flop, 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
No outcome, 

<li>
Some wasted  time. 

<li>
Probably due to some early road block that I couldn't get around <br>

</ul>
<p>
<code>10.</code> Great success: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I have a pipe line and web app that a distinct group of users highly value and that is ranked highly by google. 

<li>
I have a series of blog posts detailing how I built the app. 

<li>
My expertise is unequestionable and my reputation is outstanding. 

<li>
I choose who I work with.

</ul>

<p>

Explain your expectations, with reasoning and weighted probabilities of each outcome. Degree of confidence is important.</strong><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>0.05</code> My expectation is success, and success is ultimately down to me (notwithstanding some unexpected, unpredictable event).

<li>
<code>0.65</code> The most likely outcome is partical success: 

<ul>
<li>
a few blog posts, some meaningful progress at the start, but not a finished web app that is useful. 

<li>
This can be protected against by designing each phase to be small and self-contained, and getting positive feedback frequently. 

<li>
Writing blog posts about my work will allow me to 'see' my work, even if the app is not yet above water. This will provide encouragement and allow for reflection.

</ul>
<li>
<code>0.3</code> Flop:

<ul>
<li>
No blog posts

<li>
No learning

<li>
Cant get project off the ground because of some problem I cant solve, probably due to lack of energy or time. In this case I should break the problem into smaller parts, and keep notes on how I'm trying to solve it. Phase 1 could be split into several smaller phases (1a, 1b etc) if necessary.

Difficult to predict, but I believe that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Following my interests and doing work solely because it is interesting is a good strategy. In the past it has unlocked many great doors. Coincidentally this was reinforced by reading <a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html ">How to get startup ideas</a> by Paul Graham.

<li>
Being able to create a web app, being able to construct a data pipeline, and glue/pipe different technologies together is extremely versatile and valuable.

<li>
I need to keep my finance/accounting skills sharp and publicise them, else the chartered accountancy qualification might not be leveraged. 

<li>
I expect to learn a lot of valuable skills.

</ul>

<span id="Pipes and Glue:-15. Worst case scenario, why is this ok:"></span><strong id="15. Worst case scenario, why is this ok:">15. Worst case scenario, why is this ok:</strong><br>
I get stuck and dont achieve anything - this will be immediately discouraging and therefore I wont waste too much time on it.
Or I don't write blog posts about each stage, and no one knows my skills. This is not ok because I wont see the benefits of the effort.

<p>
<span id="Pipes and Glue:-16. What unique advantage or insight do I have?"></span><strong id="16. What unique advantage or insight do I have?">16. What unique advantage or insight do I have?</strong><br>
My background and portfolio of skills and experiences. This project is specifically designed to leverage what I already know, build on my time-tested interests, and create competencies in complimentary areas.

<span id="Pipes and Glue:-17. Who can I speak to about this?"></span><strong id="17. Who can I speak to about this?">17. Who can I speak to about this?</strong><br>
Different parts of the project will require speaking to different people. For the unix glue, I hope the devs at work will be able to help.

</p>
<ul>
<li>
5 weeks: A BTC node is running. UTXOs are being queried. I have a multiphase plan for the project. 

<li>
5 months: I have a web app, probably flash, serving streaming analytics to users which is valuable. I have a series of blogposts published about the process.

<li>
5 years: I am a senior data scientist/analyst/engineer, or a founder. I am a crypto financial data specialist. I choose where I work.
