The decision journal entry is [[diary/2018-12-28|here]].

# Each phase should be a self contained "mini project" that can be presented and explained by itself.
# Each phase needs to list all the tasks required for completion as a checkbox.
# The tasks should include blog posts, research, answering open questions, building and testing.
