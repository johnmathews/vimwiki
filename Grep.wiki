`grep -r "texthere" .`
The first parameter represents the regular expression to search for, while the second one represents the directory that should be searched.

-r recursive
-i case insensitive
-n line numbers
-H file name


E.g.: 
- `grep -n 'daily_euro_totals.csv' ./**/*.py`
- `grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'`
- `grep -rwi . -e 'draft'`

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| search filename only                                                                    | `grep -rl "filename"`                     |
| List all draft articles                                                                 | `grep -rwlIi . -e 'status: draft'`        |
| recursive                                                                               | `r`                                       |
| the expression is searched for as if its a word, not a regex                            | `w`                                       |
| only the names of files that match. Stops searching a file once a match is found (once) | `l`                                       |
| ignore case                                                                             | `i`                                       |
| ignore binary files                                                                     | `I`                                       |
| after this is the patter                                                                | `e`                                       |
| include line numbers in results                                                         | `n`                                       |
| A list of files which contain certain text: grep -rwliI . -e 'Title: thoughts' `        |                                           |
| ignore binary files. Much faster.                                                       | `-I`                                      |
| Search for a file and open it in vim                                                    | `vi $(grep -rwlI . -e 'Title: thoughts')` |
