== GSP Interviewed on the Joe Rogan podcast ==

1hr35: Asked about fighting when he is 40, GSP uses the analogy of a 4 year old
playing with a toy train. When he is 6 he realises its _just_ toy train and
get bored of it. 

Cage fighting at 40 sounds stupid to him, he will outgrow fighting and move on.

1hr46: Travelling to non-physical dimensions when you sleep... meh.

1hr50: On souls, minds, life ater death - GSP remembers how a friend of his was
in a car crash and his personality changed after. Physcially his friend was
still alive, but in another way his friend was dead and a new (different)
person was in the body his friend had.
